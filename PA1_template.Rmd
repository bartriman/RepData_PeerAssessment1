#### Introduction
This assignment is part of **Reproducible Research** course in Data Science specialization. 

#### Data 
This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day. 
Dataset can be downloaded from: [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]


#### Loading and preprocessing the data
```r
if(!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
    temp <- tempfile()
    download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",temp)
    unzip(temp)
    unlink(temp)
    rm(temp)
}

ACdata <- read.csv("activity.csv")

```


#### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Sum steps by day, create Histogram, and calculate mean and median.
```r
spd <- aggregate(steps~date, ACdata, sum)
hist(spd$steps, main = "Total steps per day", col = "pink", xlab = "Number of steps")

```
![Histogram of number of steps per day](../RepData_PeerAssessment1/figures/SPD.png)


Caluclating mean and median of steps per day
```r
rmean <- mean(spd$steps)
rmedian <- median(spd$steps)
```
Mean steps per day is: `10766.19`
Median of steps per day is: `10765`


#### What is the average daily activity pattern?
* Calculate average steps for each interval for all days. 
* Plot the Average Number Steps per Day by Interval. 
* Find interval with most average steps. 

```r
spi <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, ACdata, mean)
plot(spi$interval, spi$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps", main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```

Finding the 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```r
maxi <- spi[which.max(spi$steps),1]
```

#### Imputing missing values

Missing data were replaced with the average for each interval. For example missing data for 2012-10-01 were replaceed with mean: ```10766.19```

```r
missdatasum <- sum(!complete.cases(ACdata))
imputed_miss_data <- transform(ACdata, steps = ifelse(is.na(ACdata$steps), spi$steps[match(ACdata$interval, spi$interval)], ACdata$steps))
```
As for 2012-10-01 NA's can be observed througout the day, this is first day of observation, so zeros were imputed to keep rising trend in dataset.

```r
imputed_miss_data[as.character(imputed_miss_data$date) == "2012-10-01", 1] <- 0
```
Now total steps per day were recalculated and histogram plotted

```r
spd_i <- aggregate(steps ~ date, imputed_miss_data, sum)
hist(spd_i$steps, main = "Total Steps Per Day", col="green", xlab="Number of Steps")

hist(spd$steps, main = "Total Steps Per Day", col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed", "Non-imputed"), col=c("green", "blue"), lwd=10)
```
![Total Steps per Day with NAs repalced] path to file will go here: (figures/SPD_IMP.png)

New mean and new median ware calculated for transformed dataset:
```r
rmean_i <- mean(spd_i$steps)
rmedian_i <- median(spd_i$steps)
```

..so difference between imputed and non-imputed data could also be computed:

```r
mean_diff <- rmean_i - rmean
med_diff <- rmedian_i - rmedian
```
The total difference between imputed and non-imputed data was also calculated.
```r
total_diff <- sum(spd_i$steps) - sum(spd$steps)
```
###### Summary of computation
* new mean equals ```10589.69```
* new median equals ```10766.19```
* difference between mean for imputed and non-imputed data is ```-176.49```
* difference between median for imputed and non-imputed data is ```1.19```
* total number of steps in imputed data than in non-imputed data is higher by ```75 363``` steps



#### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
In order to determine if acctivity pattern is different in weekdays and weekends the dataset was labled with "day of week" flag: "Weekday" or "Weekend"
and plot was created to see if the difference in patterns can be marked.

Code for labeling data:
```r
imputed_miss_data$dow <- ifelse(wday(imputed_miss_data$date, week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 1)) %in% c(1,5), "Weekday", "Weekend")
```

Creating plot:
```r
spi_i <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, imputed_miss_data, mean)
xyplot(spi_i$steps ~ spi_i$interval|spi_i$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
```
![Activity pattern during the week and on weekends] path to file will go here: (figures/APWW.png)

In general we can see that overall activity during the weekend is slightly *higher* than during the week. Eventhough the maximum number of steps is lower than during the week, there are more intervals with higher number of steps. And these intervals with more steps follow eachother, creating kind of "pleatous" in the chart.
